T 1336718055 18<Jessica1>	I STILL haven't decided what this one character's ability is, and I need that before I can write a fight scene.

T 1336718324 18<Jessica1>	I'm stuck RIGHT before a fight scene because I can't decide on the design for a throwaway(?) character.
T 1336718544 18<plaidHatter>	What's the world / common abilities?
T 1336718657 18<Jessica1>	There's no ability or power that's particularly "common", they're usually just not particularly obvious until someone uses them. Some are mental, some are more of what you might call a 'magic' variety. I need this guy to have a more offensive-style ability because he strikes first and a more passive ability is going to make that WAY harder to write for given that the other guy involved is a healer and isn't fighing with offensive

T 1336719054 18<Jessica1>	That's not really important to this scene. This scene serves more to introduce a character.

T 1336719091 18<plaidHatter>	Telekenesis?
T 1336719168 18<Jessica1>	Being telekenetic to some extent or another might be considered more common, or some type of physical enhancement, though this normally would be fairly subtle. No one's growing spontaneous spikes. Well, one or two people might be, but that would be highly unusual.
T 1336719192 18<plaidHatter>	You could have this guy be a dagger 'tosser' in a sense.

T 1336767612 18<Jessica1>	A form of telekenesis that takes the form of semi-transparent rings that she can conjure around something in order to either stop it from moving or to move it somwhere else. Needless to say, it only works on things that she's strong enough to influence, so nothing too big or too strong.

T 1336777252 18<Jessica1>	I need someone to make me go, though, since i have a VERY hard time inspiring myself to work out...
T 1336777253 18<Frofidor>	ive been 145 punds for a while now
T 1336777261 18<Ashuri>	195 here.
T 1336777261 18<Jessica1>	Aww. How sad. -__-
T 1336777270 18<Jessica1>	I weigh 180 or so. And it sucks.
T 1336777293 18<Ashuri>	you're lighter than me! That's a good thing. ^_^
T 1336777300 18<Frofidor>	well yea im lucky for now but if i dont do anything i could lose my skinnyness pretty quickly
T 1336777301 18<Ashuri>	Actually, 180 is my preferred weight.
T 1336777305 18<Jessica1>	I am not tall enough to excuse weighing that much, even if my body carries it well.
T 1336777312 18<Jessica1>	You're shorter than me, Ashuri.
T 1336777317 18<Ashuri>	Aye.
T 1336777330 18<Ashuri>	Meaning I should be lighter?
T 1336777345 18<Jessica1>	Height and weight are logically correlated, though gender is also a factor.
T 1336777349 18<Ashuri>	dunno. I was an even 180 all through High School.
T 1336777360 18<Ashuri>	and I was in pretty good shape then.
T 1336777370 18<Ashuri>	far better than I am now...
T 1336777374 18<Jessica1>	Well, as a guy, you'd normally be heavier than a girl of the same height. That's how it usually works.
T 1336777382 18<Ashuri>	right.
T 1336777387 18<Jessica1>	Not factoring in build and genetic differences.
T 1336777403 18<Jessica1>	I used to be a stick. -__- NOT NO MORE.
T 1336777418 18<Frofidor>	:C
T 1336777433 18<Jessica1>	I'd be happy if I could get back down into the 160s or so...
T 1336777442 18<Ashuri>	Funny thing is, fat people used to be the symbol of beauty. XD
T 1336777450 18<Jessica1>	Well, fat used to indicate wealth.
T 1336777456 18<Ashuri>	right
T 1336777462 18<Ashuri>	now its commonplace.
T 1336777470 18<Ashuri>	so healthiness is a symbol of beauty.
T 1336777506 18<Ashuri>	(is ignoring the photoshopped beauty crammed down people's throats all the time)
T 1336777506 18<Jessica1>	Hmm...how much description of someone's clothing is considered excessive? I'm so used to having to throw a character's description into one paragraph as per RP style...
T 1336777625 18<Ashuri>	I DO have a preferred body type that I like on girls. But it all means bubcus in the end.
T 1336777626 18<Ashuri>	All in all, it's what their personality is like that determines attractiveness to me. The body is just a plus. ^_^
T 1336777638 18<Jessica1>	Attractiveness isn't always important, but it rarely hurts.
T 1336777650 18<Jessica1>	Physically, I mean
T 1336777661 18<Ashuri>	The only thing I really don't like is obesity.
T 1336777669 18<Ashuri>	But that can always be fixed.
T 1336777670 18<Ashuri>	:D
T 1336777712 18<Ashuri>	'course, skeletally skinny isn't all that attractive either... o_o
T 1336777719 18<Jessica1>	Well that's just unhealthy looking.
T 1336777728 18<Ashuri>	exactly.
T 1336777781 18<Ashuri>	I would say excessive on clothing descriptions would fall under describing where all the stitching is on the pieces.
T 1336777791 18<Ashuri>	And stuff like that.
T 1336777803 18<Jessica1>	Well unless that was relevant to the character I wouldn't go that far...xD
T 1336777809 18<Ashuri>	Just a basic description to get the image of the character into someone's head is all that's needed. ^_^
T 1336777825 18<Ashuri>	Special focus on anything important to the story.
T 1336777854 18<Ashuri>	like a particular tear on a sleeve or something.
T 1336777867 18<Ashuri>	or a scar.
T 1336777869 18<Ashuri>	etc.
T 1336777898 18<Ashuri>	nuu! no new homestuck updates! D:
T 1336777908 18<Jessica1>	I need to go back and describe Marcus' appearance...it's not PLOT important per se but his piercings are notable, as well as the fact that he wears a zip-up hoodie with the sleeves purposely torn off to be short.
T 1336777932 18<Jessica1>	But I'll worry about that later.
T 1336777941 18<Jessica1>	Oh shoot, I need to start dinner, don't I...hang on.
T 1336777953 18<Ashuri>	Interestingly, I've recently discovered exactly what my preferred type of sword is.
T 1336777991 18<Ashuri>	Katanas and European-styled blades are nice, but I think a fencing sword best suits me.
T 1336778055 18<Ashuri>	hardly any use against an armored foe (unless you stab into a gap between the pieces), but its light weight makes for really quick movements.
T 1336778676 18<Jessica1>	lol...I went to call my dad to ask where something was in the kitchen and I found it just as he picked up...
T 1336778698 18<Ashuri>	lol
T 1336779476 18<Jessica1>	Meep
T 1336779484 18<Ashuri>	moop
