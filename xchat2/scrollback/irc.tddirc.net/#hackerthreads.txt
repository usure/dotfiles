T 1336752950 18<broarch>	theres a bit of a learning curve though because fo the complexity.  like, every tank surface has a different armor rating.  the angles matter a lot... hitting an angled surface (or a flat surface at an angle) will be likely to bounce off.  hitting a surface directly perpendicular will have a high pentration value.  hitting areas like fuel tanks and engines can make the tank catch on fire.

T 1336758636 18<broless>	my answer in a nutshell: FSF does lots of great things in both legal medeling and maintaining actual software
T 1336758646 18<broless>	much of the FSF is driven by stallmans vision
T 1336758658 18<broless>	while the FSF would not cease to exist if he dies today
T 1336758664 18<broless>	it would lose a big part of the power that drives it
T 1336758671 18<broless>	and it may get replaced, but it won't be the same
T 1336758686 18<gift_>	so i guess ic ould accept that
T 1336758695 18<gift_>	but i had asked for a real life example of how that might affect my life

T 1336758742 18<broless>	and the FSF impacts your life, whether you like it or not
T 1336758757 18<gift_>	im not debating that im asking for a specific example
T 1336758764 18<gift_>	i believe you, i just dont see it
T 1336758774 18<broless>	I can't give you one specific example because it doesn't work like that
T 1336758788 18<broless>	I can't say "software X will stop existing and law Y will get pushed"
T 1336758842 18<broless>	because neither of those will happen and if they do happen you won't be able to say "this is because stallman died"
T 1336758860 18<broless>	but the FSF does a lot of good work in making sure free software keeps existing
T 1336758869 18<gift_>	for instance
