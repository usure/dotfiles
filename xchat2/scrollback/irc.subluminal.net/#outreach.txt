T 1335243756 18<prurigro>	you gotta pick and choose those carefully
T 1335243779 18<prurigro>	users are a different story
T 1335243786 18<derp>	Well, heres the thing. I dont have an issue (even though Im not a mod, Im sayin as a member) with other groups soliciting donations or w.e. its there call, if people feel the need they will donate. I just dont want people doing it on behalf of our project (misrepresentin' or what have you)
T 1335243798 18<Dan>	Well, this is the problem with having Project Meshnet at the top of the subreddit
T 1335243804 18<Dan>	as the name
T 1335243812 18<derp>	Why is that ?
T 1335243826 18<derp>	I thought i removed that when I left ( i changed it back to r/darknetplan)
T 1335243840 18<prurigro>	if you have links to corporations and facilitate donations to them
T 1335243844 18<derp>	that is irrelevant though really. you can call it r/circlejerk
T 1335243845 18<Dan>	Because every group that posts & is looking for donations appears to ba supported by Project meshnet
T 1335243846 18<prurigro>	then you are now accountable for those donations
T 1335243884 18<prurigro>	if you don't particularly care about those companies receiving donations, why risk the credibility?
T 1335243900 18<derp>	prurigro, thats why I removed the projectmeshnet stuff from that sub-reddit. The whole point of /r/darknetplan is to faciliate the discusions of meshnets and darknets 
T 1335243914 18<Dan>	look at r/darknetplan
T 1335243949 18<Dan>	it still says project meshnet at the top since we reapplied the style sheet & never changed the name
T 1335243991 18<derp>	oooh
T 1335243991 18<derp>	I forgot that the settings are only for the page <title?
T 1335243991 18<derp>	Change it, (edit stylesheet.css in community settings)
T 1335244010 18<prurigro>	there's a term in marketing called co-branding
T 1335244098 18<Dan>	yep
T 1335244108 18<prurigro>	and it goes along the lines of saying (theoretically) that a movie having apple computers in it is advertising for apple, but the movie is also using apple's name to increase its own legitimacy too
T 1335244109 18<prurigro>	anyway
T 1335244169 18<derp>	well, dan. Its up to you. If you like keep it, add the wiki and stuff to the sidebar. Thats your call
T 1335244178 18<prurigro>	separate entities supporting eachother makes a community, and the community is as attractive as the average of all the entities
T 1335244181 18<prurigro>	what companies are getting donations anyway?
T 1335244258 18<derp>	You know what would be cool? A bot posting build updates to /r/cjdns
T 1335244286 18<derp>	Mikey, Jercos, Prurigro... this is your domain. Could this be done?
T 1335244293 18<jercos>	mhm.
T 1335244299 18<jercos>	pretty easily, in fact.
T 1335244309 18<prurigro>	yea, reddit's api is open
T 1335244312 18<prurigro>	so why not eh
T 1335244320 18<derp>	Because, they kinda get lost in the #cjdns chan
T 1335244327 18<jercos>	All we'd need is a tiny hack duct-taped on the existing build-bot
T 1335244337 18<jercos>	it could post to reddit *and* IRC :p
T 1335244347 18<jercos>	there are reddit modules for like every programming language
T 1335244381 18<prurigro>	what content would be posted?
T 1335244429 18<jercos>	CJDNS updates, as a selfpost with the changelog, or as a linkpost linking to the github commit
T 1335244491 18<derp>	Selfpost with changelog and github commit link would be epic
T 1335244537 18<derp>	we could even restrict /r/cjdns to the buildbot posts
T 1335244599 18<prurigro>	I think things like the launch of hyperboria forums
T 1335244601 18<prurigro>	for example
T 1335244606 18<prurigro>	make sense to go there too

T 1335323911 18<Dan>	yep
T 1335324043 18<imw>	hello!
T 1335324049 18<imw>	My name is Isaac
T 1335324083 18<Dan>	Hey, I'm Dan. I think I've seen you on irc before
T 1335324117 18<imw>	I am wondering why you would want to use cjd over, say, a modular stack with separate parts for routing, serving, and tunnelling
T 1335324144 18<imw>	for instance, a freedombox running babeld attached to a couple of tplink radios with directionals
T 1335324162 18<imw>	I want to understand why folks are so excited about cjdns
T 1335324164 18<imw>	I just don't get it
T 1335324172 18<imw>	I don't mean to be a naysayer
T 1335324209 18<Dan>	Eh, its simpler to have one small package doing all the routing, tunneling & eventually dns functions than seperate modules for each
T 1335324210 18<imw>	I've dedicated my whole life to decentralized networks, I just don't see why we would choose cjd over actual, mature routing protocols
T 1335324262 18<imw>	hmm
T 1335324297 18<imw>	it seems like it works alright in a virtual network
T 1335324323 18<imw>	but there's no loop avoidance or convergence properties to assure performance in lossy environments
T 1335324345 18<imw>	so I fear that it won't scale well in terms of actual physical networks.
T 1335324372 18<Dan>	Cjdns is still in alpha, atm the Seattle branch of project meshnet is using the BATMAN routing protocol then layering cjdns on top
T 1335324391 18<imw>	so, again, why use cjd?
T 1335324399 18<imw>	I don't understand why it's necessary
T 1335324414 18<imw>	we use BATMAN or Babel in our meshes
T 1335324419 18<imw>	have used OLSR, too
T 1335324441 18<imw>	it just seems like such a waste of time and energy to have all these folks that want to build mesh networks, and to put all their energy into this pet project
T 1335324462 18<imw>	again, I don't mean to be too harsh, but it seems like emperor has no clothes
T 1335324474 18<Dan>	cjdns has issues and the ones you mentioned above are one of many. Over time they'll get fixed, but cjdns is suppoed to eventually take over most everything in a nice clean package.
T 1335324503 18<imw>	okay, but there are already things that do most of this stuff, and do it well
T 1335324511 18<imw>	why not just integrate the existing tools?
T 1335324518 18<imw>	why start from scratch?
T 1335324519 18<Dan>	THe software devs are focusing on cjdns, while everyone else focuses on the physical aspect
T 1335324533 18<Dan>	brb
T 1335324553 18<imw>	the intense focus on cjd as the answer is turning serious mesh networking experts away
T 1335324556 18<imw>	I'm just saying
T 1335324595 18<imw>	all of that software development energy would be better spent working on freedombox
T 1335324612 18<imw>	which has the support of the debian community, and can leverage the GPG strong set to actually launch a trust network
T 1335324617 18<Dan>	yep, it is an issue that Project Meshnet needs to work on,  derp & others essentially bet the project on cjdns
T 1335324639 18<imw>	I've reached out before, and I really want to work with you all

T 1335325129 18<Mikey>	why use anything?  why ask questions like "why do you use this free software that all the source code is published for?" etc
T 1335325147 18<imw>	well, I've looked at the source
T 1335325150 18<Mikey>	because cjdns has a distinctive flavor and settles my stomach
T 1335325165 18<imw>	fair enough

T 1335325455 18<derp>	thats known nodes, not live nodes
T 1335325471 18<imw>	okay, but don't you want to engineer for a scenario in which you're successful?
T 1335325474 18<Mikey>	i promise when zuck sat down to write "the facebook" he wasn't going "how am i going to scale this to 500M users"
T 1335325489 18<Dan>	well, the 40 figure is reachable in one or two hops, 500 is the total
T 1335325496 18<Mikey>	besides, the internet of the future needs to scale UP and DOWN
T 1335325504 18<derp>	and around

T 1336156766 18<adminsystem>	so i know i'm weak in that area
T 1336156774 18<Dan>	I'd recommend Nanostation M5 & M2 radios, they are $85 a pop new
T 1336156797 18<Dan>	versus $150 a pop for Nanostation M365
T 1336156824 18<Dan>	Also, POE adapters are included when you buy UBNT hardware new
T 1336156835 18<Dan>	UBNT=Ubiquiti
T 1336156837 18<adminsystem>	ooohhh
T 1336156841 18<Dan>	yeah
T 1336156844 18<adminsystem>	i didn't know it came w/ poe
T 1336156854 18<Dan>	well, it works out of the box
T 1336156857 18<adminsystem>	everytime i buy poe equipment i either have to get a poe switch or a brick
T 1336156863 18<Dan>	yep
T 1336156866 18<adminsystem>	ok i'll change the faq
T 1336156870 18<Dan>	kk
T 1336156871 18<adminsystem>	phase 2 will have nanostation m5s
T 1336156882 18<adminsystem>	what's the diff between m5 and m2?
T 1336156929 18<Dan>	the M5 operates at 5ghz, which is fairly clean in every major city, but one or two trees in a links path will take it down
T 1336156982 18<adminsystem>	what about going through walls or fog?
T 1336157000 18<Dan>	the M2 operates at 2.4ghz, which is a hot mess, it can penetrate 4 or 5 trees to make a link, but you'll br competeing with other band users
T 1336157030 18<Dan>	Fog isn't a big deal, it won't hurt a link too terribly
T 1336157032 18<adminsystem>	yeah in my block alone i pickup about 40 wifi stations just sitting at home
T 1336157055 18<Dan>	You should ideally put these in windows or on roofs
T 1336157076 18<Dan>	yeah, 2.4ghz=shitty
T 1336157076 18<adminsystem>	that was my intention
T 1336157081 18<adminsystem>	as close to line of sight as possible
T 1336157081 18<Dan>	yep
T 1336157101 18<adminsystem>	ok so how about just M5s then?
T 1336157125 18<Dan>	It'll work a fair distance with Near line of sight
T 1336157149 18<Dan>	with LoS you can gt 15km out of them
T 1336157150 18<adminsystem>	is it possible to do a dual link node? m5 and m2
T 1336157156 18<Dan>	yep
T 1336157163 18<adminsystem>	interesting
T 1336157165 18<Dan>	you can do failover too
T 1336157172 18<Dan>	or bond them
T 1336157206 18<adminsystem>	can you do bond with failover?  e.g. if one goes down the networking still works?
T 1336157218 18<Dan>	Also, why are you planning to put a shuttle pc at each node? each nanostation can run openwrt+cjdns
T 1336157235 18<adminsystem>	for hosting a server
T 1336157251 18<Dan>	eh, whahtever, it seems way overkill
T 1336157265 18<adminsystem>	building a network without content seems silly
T 1336157271 18<Dan>	also, assume you'll need 2 nanostations per link
T 1336157275 18<adminsystem>	but yeah it might be overkill for the start
T 1336157289 18<Dan>	I'd just use a $50 p4 at each site
T 1336157299 18<Dan>	its cheaper
T 1336157311 18<adminsystem>	well what i can do 
T 1336157315 18<adminsystem>	just to get the ball rolling
T 1336157318 18<Dan>	failover & bonding can be done
T 1336157323 18<adminsystem>	and make things as cheap as possible
T 1336157325 18<adminsystem>	is change Phase 1
T 1336157331 18<Dan>	yep
T 1336157333 18<Dan>	I gtg
T 1336157341 18<Dan>	be back in an hour
T 1336157341 18<adminsystem>	to get funding just just the nano running openwrt
